# 2024-12-log4j-to-xz

Slides etc for "From log4j to xz" as presented at BSides Austin, 2024-12-05.

Will post video if/when it's available.

The PDF in this repo will download but if you try to view it in-browser you may get some weird "Unable to render code block" error from GitHub. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If it really is messed up I also have the slides in my personal domain: https://novarese.net/talks/2024-12_From_Log4j_to_XZ.pdf

My other slides etc are cataloged in https://github.com/pvnovarese/talks
